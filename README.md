# ecg_signal_analysis_for_mi_detection
Myocardial Infarction is one of the fatal heart diseases. It is essential that a patient is monitored for the early detection of MI. Owing to the newer technology such as wearable sensors which are capable of transmitting wirelessly, this can be done easily. However, there is a need for real-time applications that are able to accurately detect MI non-invasively. This project studies a prospective method by which we can detect MI. Our approach analyses the ECG (electrocardiogram) of a patient in real-time and extracts the ST elevation from each cycle. The ST elevation plays an important part in MI detection. We then use the sequential change point detection algorithm; CUmulative SUM (CUSUM), to detect any deviation in the ST elevation spectrum and to raise an alarm if we find any.
